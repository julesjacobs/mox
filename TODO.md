# Enchanced .mox files

- Allow lets to scope over multiple expressions
- Better errors

# Interpreter with sanitizer

- Make an interpreter for the language 
- The interpreter should be able to run small-step semantics, essentially, for thread interleaving
- It should detect data races, type errors, stack allocation violations (use after free), uniqueness use-after-destruct violations

# Mode polymorphism

- Add let polymorphism, including polymorphism over modes

# Mode axis refactors

- Think about better ways to organize the mode axes, e.g., co-contended.

# User defined types

- User defined type definitions

# Syntactic sugar

- Nested pattern matches
- let f x = .. function definitions

# User defined mode axes

- Allow users to introduce new mode axes and points on those axes

# Codex todolist

[add todolist here]
