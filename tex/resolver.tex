\section{Roadmap}

This document sketches the relational solver that accompanies the Mox type system notes.
The goal is to develop a mode solver that is powerful enough to handle the mode constraints produced by the type checker.

At a high level, we will develop a solver for binary constraints between modes.
We will first analyze a class of constraints that can be solved in polynomial time.
Then we will develop a more powerful solver that can handle that class of constraints.

\section{Constraint Language}

As a first step, assume we have a finite domain $V$ of values, and a set of binary relations $R_i \subseteq V \times V$.
Given a set of variables and asserted contraints between them, we want to determine if there exists a valuation of the variables that satisfies all the constraints.

In general this is a NP-complete problem: consider $V=\{0,1,2,\dots,k\}$ and $R_1 = \{ (a,b) \mid a \neq b \} \subseteq V \times V$.
Given a graph we can use this constraints to encode the $k$-coloring problem: we want to assign a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The $k$-coloring problem is NP-complete, so this problem is also NP-complete.

However, certain classes of constraints can be solved in polynomial time. Consider the set of constraints $R_i = \{ (a,b) \mid b \geq a + i \} \subseteq V \times V$. Given a graph of variables and constraints, we can solve this problem in polynomial time using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

Equivalently, we can solve the problem by variable elimination: we take a variable $x$ and all adjacent constraints on it. We assert all transitive constraints (where $R_i$ composes with $R_j$ to produce $R_{i+j}$) and repeat until all variables are eliminated.
If, during this process, we ever see a constraint between a variable and itself with $i \neq 0$, then the constraints are unsatisfiable.

Why does this elimination strategy work for this class of constraints, but not for the general case, and in particular for the $k$-coloring problem with inequality constraints?

Consider a variable $x$ with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a set of predecessors $a_1,a_2,a_3$ with $R_{i_1}(a_1,x), R_{i_2}(a_2,x), R_{i_3}(a_3,x)$ constraints on them,
    \item a set of successors $b_1,b_2$ with $R_{j_1}(x,b_1), R_{j_2}(x,b_2)$ constraints on them,
\end{itemize}
When eliminating $x$, we assert every transitive constraint $R_{i_p + j_q}(a_p,b_q)$ for $p \in \{1,2,3\}$ and $q \in \{1,2\}$:

I claim that if there is a solution for the neighboring variables that satisfies all of those transitive constraints, then there is a solution for $x$ that satisfies the original constraints: we can simply set $x$ to any value in the interval $\max(a_1 + i_1, a_2 + i_2, a_3 + i_3) \leq x \leq \min(b_1 + j_1, b_2 + j_2)$. This interval is guaranteed to be non-empty if the transitive constraints hold.

The key blocker for $k$-coloring is that this property does not hold for inequality constraints. Suppose for example we have a vertex $x$ and $k+1$ neighbors with inequality constraints. The transitive constraints are trivial if $k \geq 3$, because if we have $a \neq x \neq b$, then for a given value of $a$, all values of $b$ are still possible, by choosing a particular value for $x$. Thus, the strategy of variable elimination does not work for $k$-coloring, for $k \geq 3$: for $\neq$ constraints, eliminating $x$ produces no useful transitives; every neighbour pair remains unconstrained:

The OxCaml mode solver has constraints of the form $x \leq G(y)$ where $G$ are modalities with left adjoints. Like the interval constraints we considered above, these constraints can be solved in polynomial time using variable elimination, and for the same reason.

\subsection{Which constraints can be solved by elimination?}

For a set of constraints to be solvable by elimination, we need that the original problem has a solution iff the transformed problem has a solution. We will now analyze precisely when this property holds, and provide an easily checkable criterion for it.

\newcommand{\RelSet}{\mathsf{Rel}}
Let's first analyze the problem more precisely. Given a domain $V$ and a family of relations $\RelSet \subseteq \mathcal{P}(V \times V)$, the elimination algorithm may construct new relations in the following four ways:

\begin{itemize}
  \item It composes two relations $R,S \in \RelSet$ to produce $$RS = \{ (a,b) \mid \exists c.\ (a,c) \in R \land (c,b) \in S \}$$
  \item It intersects two relations $R,S \in \RelSet$ when it merges two parallel edges $$R \cap S = \{ (a,b) \mid (a,b) \in R \land (a,b) \in S \}$$
  \item It reverses the direction of a relation $R \in \RelSet$ to produce $$R^T = \{ (b,a) \mid (a,b) \in R \}$$
  \item We strengthen a relation $R \in \RelSet$ asserted between a variable and itself
  $$R^\ast = \{ (a,a) \mid (a,a) \in R \}$$
\end{itemize}

We therefore first close $\RelSet$ under these three operations. If the domain $V$ is finite, the resulting set of relations is finite.

Without loss of generality, we can picture the relations adjacent to a particular variable $x$ as follows:

\[
  \begin{tikzpicture}[>=Latex]
    \node[graphnode] (xcore) at (0,0) {$x$};

    \foreach \idx/\angle in {1/90,2/18,3/-54,4/-126,5/162} {
      \node[graphnode] (y\idx) at (\angle:3) {$y_{\idx}$};
      \draw[->] (xcore) -- node[pos=0.55,above,sloped] {$R_{\idx}$} (y\idx);
    }

    \draw[->] (xcore) .. controls (-0.45,-0.9) and (0.45,-0.9) .. node[pos=0.5,below] {$R_{0}$} (xcore);

      }

        \node[graphnode] (yA\idx) at (\angle:2.3) {$y_{\idx}$};
        \draw[->] (yA\idx) .. controls +({\angle+30}:0.8) and +({\angle-30}:0.8) .. (yA\idx);
